# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements an end-to-end **phishing detection pipeline** leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing based on extracted features.

## üìÇ **Dataset**

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Web Page Phishing Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- **Size**: ~48 engineered features per URL

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Project Pipeline**

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed missing values.
   - Encoded target labels (phishing=1, legitimate=0).

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Correlation-based feature selection with **threshold > 0.2**, reducing dimensionality significantly.

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Standardised features using **StandardScaler**.

4. **Model Training & Tuning**
   - Trained and hyperparameter tuned:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting
     - SVM
     - KNN
   - Used **GridSearchCV (5-fold)** for optimal parameters.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Computed accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and classification report for each model.
   - **Achieved ~98% test accuracy** using Random Forest.

6. **Model Interpretability**
   - Implemented SHAP analysis to interpret feature importances over 1000 samples.

7. **Deployment**
   - Saved trained Random Forest model and scaler using **pickle** for future integration.
